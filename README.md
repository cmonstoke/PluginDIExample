# PluginDIExample
Cleaned up version of the orignal repo posted in comments of this Spigot DI plugin example taken from this [article](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/tutorial-spigot-plugins-dependency-injection.295218/) about DI with MC plugins by [MrDienns](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/mrdienns.35704/) on spigotmc.org

Note you should not use the Master branch as it won't work. I will look to maintain develop to ensure it works with the latest release of spigot but don't hold your breath. And if it does fail look for a branch that matches your server version.
